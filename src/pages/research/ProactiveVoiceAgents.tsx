          <p>
            Voice AI has become a standard way to build conversational
            interfaces. The typical architecture is straightforward: user speaks
            → speech-to-text → LLM processes → text-to-speech → system responds.
            This works well when users are actively engaged and responsive.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this reactive design creates a critical failure mode:{" "}
            <strong>if the user doesn't speak, nothing happens</strong>. In any
            real-world application, users will inevitably:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Take time to think before responding</li>
            <li>Get distracted or multitask</li>
            <li>Intentionally test the system's boundaries</li>
            <li>Fall silent during difficult tasks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We encountered this problem when deploying our AI tutoring system to
            families. Students quickly discovered they could stop lessons
            entirely by simply not speaking. This post describes how we solved
            it by making voice agents inherently proactive—capable of taking
            initiative, handling barge-ins, and maintaining engagement even when
            users are silent.

            The traditional voice agent is a relatively linear pipeline, shown

            Through this simple pipeline of speech-to-text (STT), LLM calls, and
            text-to-speech (TTS), you can get a simple, fast, and effective
            voice agent running.

            Many optimizations can be made around chunk streaming, context

          Classic Pipeline + Silence Words
        </h2>
        <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            If a user stops speaking, we can usually detect the silence. At
            minimum, we can keep a timer for when the last STT trigger happened.
            Using this timer, we can trigger audio playback of example words to
            re-engage the user, like "Are you there?" or "Hello?"
          </p>
          <p>
            This works well, but doesn't allow for contextual silence timeouts.
            If a student is working on a hard problem, we might want to wait for
            a minute. But if they aren't responding to a simple conversational
            question, we might want to wait 10 seconds.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-python">{`last_stt_time = now()

def on_user_speech(user, audio_chunks):
    new_words = speech_to_text(audio_chunks)
    last_stt_time = now()
    response = llm.call(context + new_words)
    audio_chunks_out = text_to_speech(response)
    user.play_audio(audio_chunks_out)

while True:
    if now() - last_stt_time > 30:  # seconds

        </h2>
        <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            The only way to make contextual decisions about silence is to use
            the conversation itself. So, we can have an LLM decide what to do:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-python">{`last_stt_time = now()

def on_user_speech(user, audio_chunks):
    ...

while True:
    if now() - last_stt_time > 30:  # seconds
        llm_decide_what_to_do()`}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Maybe the LLM will decide to play one of the re-engagement audio
            prompts like "Hey, are you still there?", and maybe the agent will
            do nothing. It depends on context.
          </p>
          <p>
            This works better, but key questions remain: how long to wait, what
            choices to offer, and when to do nothing. Shorter timeouts call the
            model more often, increasing errors and cost.

          Flipped Pipeline

        <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            In the above example, we've subtly separated the event loop of the
            agent from the user input. Even without user input, the agent is
            going to run! Let's take this to the extreme and see what happens:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-python">{`context = new Context()
tools = [speak, ...]

def speak(words):
    audio_chunks_out = text_to_speech(words)
    user.play_audio(audio_chunks_out)

def on_user_speech(user, audio_chunks):
    new_words = speech_to_text(audio_chunks)
    context.add(new_words)

while True:
    resp = llm.call(context, tools)
    context.add(resp)`}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Now we've fully separated the agent from the user. The agent runs
            even if no one is on the call. This has clear advantages:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              The agent now decides what to do at every moment, which is closer
              to how humans work.
            </li>
            <li>
              The turn-taking "you speak, I speak" method of the classical
              pipeline is completely gone. Now the agent can speak first, speak
              twice, or even wait for you to complete a task.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, this is incomplete. Calling the model every loop is
            expensive—especially when most loops should do nothing.

        <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>To fix this, let's give the agent the ability to wait.</p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-python">{`context = new Context()
tools = [speak, wait, ...]

def speak(words):
    audio_chunks_out = text_to_speech(words)
    user.play_audio(audio_chunks_out)

def wait(seconds):
    sleep(seconds)

def on_user_speech(user, audio_chunks):
    new_words = speech_to_text(audio_chunks)
    context.add(new_words)

while True:
    resp = llm.call(context, tools)
    context.add(resp)`}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Now the agent can wait. With simple prompting, it will speak, wait,
            check in with the user, and even handle tasks while the user speaks.
          </p>
          <p>Once again, there are drawbacks. Notably:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>handling user barge-in</li>
            <li>waiting for users to finish speaking</li>
            <li>ensuring that context is always fresh</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These become challenges.</p>

        <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            The cleanest solution to the problems above is to add a blocking
            barge-in handler—so the entire execution of the agent stalls while
            the user speaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            This ensures that the agent always waits for the user to be finished
            before making its next decision—and prevents the agent from speaking
            over the user. The pseudocode for this gets quite complicated, so
            we'll let you figure it out for yourself :)
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use any number of voice activity detection (VAD) systems
            like Silero, Pipecat's Smart-Turn, or Deepgram's Flux (our choice)
            to determine when the user has started and stopped speaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once implemented, the voice agent will run independently of the user
            in a clean manner. When the user speaks, the agent will pause and
            wait for them to finish—then continue its loop.

            Without optimization, running a proactive voice agent like this can

          <p>
            Latency was worst when the agent was mid-task (for example, using
